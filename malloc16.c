/*
 *  MALLOC16.C
 *
 *  Written on 13-Apr-98 by Tobias Ernst and released to the public domain.
 *
 *  This file provides the malloc16() and free16() functions. These functions
 *  allocate a memory block that is guaranteed to NOT cross a 64K boundary
 *  and to reside below the magic 512 MB boundary on OS/2.
 *
 *  Note that a pointer that has been alloc'ed with malloc16() MUST be
 *  freed by free16(). Never pass it to free(), and never pass a pointer
 *  that has been alloc'ed with malloc() to free16()!!!
 *
 *  You need to allocate memory with these functions, for example, if you
 *  whish to pass a pointer on to a 16 bit OS/2 API function, like the
 *  Vio* functions that have not changed since OS/2 1.3.
 *
 *  If you pass a pointer to the Vio* functions that has been allocated
 *  with standard malloc, the code will run a thousand times without problems,
 *  but in the 1001st time (when the pointer malloc returned accidentally
 *  crosses 1 64k boundary), you will get heap corruption because the Vio
 *  function writes to the wrong memory area. It took me over a month
 *  to find out that this was the reason that my EMX compiled MsgEd crashed
 *  once a week, while it worked OK for the rest of the time ......
