The subdirectories of this directory contain character set translation tables
that enable FSC 0054 /FSP 1013 CHRS support for MsgEd TE.

You must select exactly one readmaps.* and one writmaps.* file that
matches your configuration and then use the "readmap" and "writemap"
keywords in the Msged configuration to point to the correct file.
Example:

 Readmap  c:\msged\readmaps.850
 Writemap c:\msged\writmaps.850

Note:  You must select the map that matches YOUR computer, not the
map that matches the charset that you want to use for message
transport.  So if you have a KOI8-R computer, use readmaps
writmaps.koi even if you want to write mails in CP866 charset.

Please refer to the Msged manual for more information.  (Chapter "Advanced
Concepts", Section "Using Umlauts ...").

The following character set maps are provided:

Filename     | Type of font / character set / computer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
READMAPS.850 | Any DOS or OS/2 computer, or Windows computer with the OEM
WRITMAPS.850 | console fonts, that uses Codepage 850. This applies to most
             | computers in Western Europe. Some badly configured Linux
             | systems might also use this code page.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
READMAPS.437 | Any DOS or OS/2 computer, or Windows computer with the OEM
WRITMAPS.437 | fonts, that uses the standard codepage 437. This applies to
             | most US-American installations, and also to some European
             | ones that use Codepage 850 because it has some more IBM
             | graphics characters.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
READMAPS.865 | This is the "nordic" IBM Codepage 865 used in some
WRITMAPS.865 | Northern European countries.

WRITMAPS.UKR | Windows installations for text mode applications in

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
READMAPS.IS1 | This is ISO 8859-1. It is the standard encoding for
WRITMAPS.IS1 | X11 fonts and console fonts on Linux and Unix systems
             | in Western Europe.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
READMAPS.IS5 | This is ISO 8859-5. It is the encoding used for vendor
WRITMAPS.IS5 | shipped additional fonts in Russian editions of commercial
             | Unix systems.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
READMAPS.KOI | This is KOI8-R, used by the cyrillic cronyx font set,
WRITMAPS.KOI | which is in use in almost any Russian Linux or FreeBSD
             | installation, and can of course also be installed on
             | commercial Unix systems.
